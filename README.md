## Tech Stack
- React + TypeScript + Vite
- SCSS with CSS variables for theming
- Framer Motion for animation
- React Router for navigation
- Octokit for GitHub data

## Run Locally
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## GitHub Pages
This repo is configured for GitHub Pages:
- Vite base path is set to `/Portfolio/`
- Router uses `import.meta.env.BASE_URL` for correct routing under the repo path
- A SPA redirect is included so deep links like `/blog` work on refresh
- GitHub Actions deploys `dist` to Pages on every push to `main`

To enable Pages in GitHub:
1. In the repository settings, open Pages.
2. Set the source to GitHub Actions.
