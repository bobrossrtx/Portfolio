Hey, welcome to my portfolio.

I’m Owen Boreham, a 19-year-old, self-taught programmer with a wide range of IT and programming interests. I spend most of my time building things, breaking them, and trying to understand how they work under the hood. I’m into systems work, language design, and building clean, sharp user experiences.

You’ll see projects like Demi (my custom programming language) and Census Conquest show up around here. TinyKernel exists too, but it’s been on ice for a while — if I pick it back up, I’ll probably restart it in C++ the same way I did with Demi. I also post more general stuff when I feel like it — opinions on tech, lessons learned, and music/DJ posts.

If you’re here for deep dives, dev logs, or just to see what I’m working on, you’re in the right place. Also, I’m not a career DJ — I just have decks and mix for fun — but music is still a big part of my life, so it’ll pop up here.

Thanks for stopping by.
